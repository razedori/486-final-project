# 486-final-project

The purpose of this project is to predict movie ratings using my own data, that way I will know what to expect from an upcoming movie. I've been less time every year, so watching a movie that it won't be enjyable it feel like a waste of time and I believe that this model can help me and other people that have their data on IMDB.

The only file on this repository is the code itself, the graphs are there when you run the program
